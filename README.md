Common Pipe Overhaul
====================

There is a deliverable to do some form of overhaul of the common pipe simulation for EnergyPlus plants.  This repo will contain lots of files related to this work.  My plan is to:

- Get some folks feedback on the existing model
- Make up a ton of test files to evaluate what works and what doesn't
- Work up some thoughts on a new design
- Iterate on the design and some prototypes
- Work toward final implementation

## Documentation [![](https://readthedocs.org/projects/common-pipe-redo/badge/?version=latest)](http://common-pipe-redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I'll be documenting this project on [RTD](http://common-pipe-redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for fun.  Right now it contains lots of information about the way I am creating test files.
